<H1>Adding screen modes</H1>

<P>
This document describes <CODE>config/gfxmodes.txt</CODE>, an advanced configuration file with which you can add otherwise unavailable screen modes to Outgun.
</P>

<P>
You don&rsquo;t need <CODE>gfxmodes.txt</CODE> in normal operation; it&rsquo;s useful if Outgun doesn&rsquo;t detect the mode you want to use. One usual case is that you want to run Outgun in a window with a custom size or even other than 4:3 geometry. Note that whichever ratio you choose, Outgun always treats the screen as if pixels were square, and therefore the playfield is always sized 4:3 in pixels.
</P>

<P>
The format Outgun 1.0 understands is very simple. Every non-empty line that is not a comment (those start with a semicolon, &lsquo;;&rsquo;), should describe a screen mode. The lines should include a <STRONG>width</STRONG>, a <STRONG>height</STRONG>, and a <STRONG>colordepth</STRONG>, separated by spaces. For example the line<BR>
<CODE>640 480 32</CODE><BR>
adds the resolution of 640×480 with 32 bits per pixel. There are limitations: the width must be at least 320 pixels (640 before Outgun 1.0.3), the height at least 200 (400 before 1.0.3), and accepted values for color depth are 16, 24, and 32.
</P>

<P>
When the basic limits are met, Outgun accepts the mode and makes it available in the menu, without testing it in any way. Note that you can&rsquo;t choose whether the mode is usable in full screen and/or window, it&rsquo;s always made available to both even if it doesn&rsquo;t actually work in one. Naturally, in windowed mode the width and height determine the size of the window, and in full screen, the resolution &ndash; just as with the automatically detected modes. Usually almost any size can be used in a window (larger than the desktop obviously isn&rsquo;t useful), while there are limited options for full screen which depend on the gfx card.
</P>

<P>
For easy testing of which modes work, or fine tuning a window size, you can edit the file while Outgun is running. <CODE>gfxmodes.txt</CODE> is reloaded each time you open the <A HREF="menus.html#screenmode">screen mode</A> menu.
