<H1>Outgun sound themes</H1>

<P>
If you want sounds in the game, you must provide sound files with the following names
for the respective game events.

</TABLE>

<P>
After that, you must create a directory under the <CODE>sound</CODE> directory, e.g.
<SAMP>C:\outgun\sound\mysounds</SAMP>.
</P>
<P>
Then place your sounds there. You can add a <CODE>theme.txt</CODE> text file to this
directory. The first line of the file will contain the description of your sound theme.
</P>
<P>
If you want to have the same sound in two events, you don&rsquo;t have to copy the sound file. Instead, you can make a redirection. To make player bounce sound same as wall bounce sound, make <CODE>plbounce.txt</CODE> file. Write on the first line of that file <CODE>wabounce</CODE>. That way Outgun uses <CODE>wabounce.wav</CODE> instead of <CODE>plbounce.wav</CODE>.
