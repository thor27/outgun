; This is an Outgun translation file.
; Original copyright © 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008 Jani Rivinoja, Niko Ritari
; Translation copyright © 2008 <no one>


; Language of the translation, in the target language.
English

; Locale to decide the correct decimal separator (e.g. fi_FI or pt_BR).
locale


; You should not modify en.txt, it is the English reference file. Outgun uses
; it (only) to index the translated strings. To make a new translation, copy
; en.txt to a new name (languagename.txt) and translate each phrase (non-
; commented line) in that file. Please send your translation to us at
; outgun@mbnet.fi for inclusion in the official packages.

; The length restrictions mentioned in the comments should guarantee that the
; translations fit on the screen in the 640×400 resolution with a 8×8 font that
; is the default. To allow for smaller resolutions or larger fonts, shorter is
; always better.

; Generic terms. Currently, 'unknown' is used in the graphics menu for a
; refresh rate and in the local server menu for IP address; 'private' and
; 'invalid' are also for IP address; 'default' is used in font selection;
; 'none' (meaning "not set"), 'on', and 'off' in the server settings dialog
; (F5), as well as 'special' which is used for the player collisions setting.
; 'Disabled', 'minimal', and 'complete' are currently values of the automatic
; bug reporting policy setting. 'Never', 'always', 'in same room',
; 'single-roomed' and 'multi-roomed' are currently used in multiple settings
; in the graphics menu. OK and Cancel are used in the menus, in their
; usual UI meaning. All may be used elsewhere in a similar context in the
; future.

; Length restrictions vary:
; With the standard resolution (640 in width) and standard 8-wide font, the end
; of the line is not visible after 76 characters. The actual maximal length of
; each text depends on the type of the menu component and many lines are made
; of two parts.
;
; Usually, considerably longer than original texts do fit well. To be sure
; they fit, you should test each menu in the standard resolution and preferably
; a wider-than-standard font, if you use translations that are considerably
; longer than the original texts.
