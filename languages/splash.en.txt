To help us remove any remaining bugs, you can let Outgun automatically send us a notification when an unexpected failure occurs. You can choose between no reporting, minimal information, and a complete report. The minimal information includes no more than the file name and line number of the failing assertion, and the version of Outgun. The complete report also includes a copy of Outgun's stack. This information is only used to find the cause of the failure. We can't contact you for more information, so it is recommended to also send an e-mail with more details.
