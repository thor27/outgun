Game concept
 
 You are a member of a team, either red or blue, assigned to you at random when you connect. Your goal is to help your team to win, by capturing the enemy flag. To capture the flag, a member of your team must steal the enemy flag and bring it to your team's flag, provided your flag has not been stolen already.
 
Health and energy
 
 If your health drops to zero, you die. Energy is used for running, shooting and health protection when you have the shield powerup. Health and energy regenerate to 200 with time.
 
Minimap
 
 On the upper-right corner of the screen is the minimap. It shows your teammates and the opponents seen by them. If you have the shadow powerup, it shows all the opponents who don't have the shadow themselves.
 
Powerups
 
 If you see an item lying on the ground, grab it. It's a special powerup item.
